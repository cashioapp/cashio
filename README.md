## About

Cashio is a decentralized stablecoin fully backed by interest-bearing [Saber](https://saber.so) USD liquidity provider tokens. Cashio specifically chooses USD LPs that are backed by safer USD assets, attempting to capture the risk-free rate of the Solana stablecoin ecosystem.

Using [Arrow Protocol](https://arrowprotocol.com), Cashio stakes LP tokens into [Sunny Aggregator](https://sunny.ag), earning $SBR and $SUNNY tokens to the Cashio DAO. Cashio also uses [Crate Protocol](https://crateprotocol.com) to build its USD-pegged stablecoin, which can be thought of as a basket of stablecoin LPs.

_Currently, protocol profits accrue to a program-owned account known as the Bank. We intend to create a mechanism to have these cash flows accrue value to users of the Cashio Protocol. More information on this will be available soon._
